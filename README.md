# Getting Started
The world grows at a very fast pace, and so does the airline industry. An airline company requires a lot of management activities at the airport and at the same time, on the servers.
An airline website helps users to book tickets online, at the comfort of the user.

Therefore, the idea behind our project is to understand and simulate the mechanism behind the Airline Websites.
